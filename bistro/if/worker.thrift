   * Invoked whenever a worker connects to a scheduler for the first time.
   * This means the scheduler can be restarted without losing running tasks.
   *
   * Rationale: One alternative is to include the full set of running tasks
   * with every heartbeat.  However, these updates can arrive out of order
   * relative to runTask and updateStatus, making it very hard to properly
   * reconcile the modifications to the scheduler state, even with global
   * sequence numbers.  Reconciliation becomes easier with per-task sequence
   * numbers, but this has a high implementation complexity, and a
   * significant performance overhead with tens of thousands of tasks per
   * second.  Instead, we only send the full list of running tasks when a
   * worker first connects, and rely on robust implementations of runTask &
   * updateStatus to keep the scheduler's state in sync with its workers.
   *
   * Robustness:
   *  - [failure]: If the call fails, the scheduler will keep the worker in
   *    a NEW (not healthy) state, retrying frequently, until it either
   *    succeeds, or the worker reaches its suicide timeout.
   *  - [partial failure, replay, delay]: Read-only query, needs no protection.
   *  - [identity] Checks worker ID. Does not check the scheduler ID, since
   *    this often arrives just before the worker associates with a new
   *    scheduler. This is a read-only call, so the only consequence of
   *    responding to the wrong scheduler is that this scheduler may e.g.
   *    move this worker from a NEW to a HEALTHY state, and try to runTask.
   *    Of course, its runTask()s would fail, so no real harm is done.

   * Start the requested task on the worker if the worker considers itself

   * If this succeeds, it is guaranteed that the worker will follow up with
   * updateStatus (or die, in which case its tasks usually die too).  If
   * this throws a BistroWorkerException, it is guaranteed that the task is
   * not running, and can be retried safely.  For any other error, the
   * scheduler may neither assume that the task is running nor that it is
   * not running.  Instead, it must use notifyIfTasksNotRunning to find out.
   *
   * Robustness:
   *  - [failure] The only bona fide failure is when the worker throws
   *    BistroWorkerException, and that gets delivered successfully to the
   *    scheduler.  In that case, the scheduler knows the task is not
   *    running, and it will retry, likely on a different worker.
   *  - [partial failure] On any other kind of failure (e.g. a transport
   *    error), the scheduler is neither sure that the task is running nor
   *    that it is not running.  It will check via notifyIfTasksNotRunning.
   *  - [replay] A replay would occur if the scheduler sends a second
   *    runTask while a task with the same task ID (job + node, not task
   *    instance ID) is already running.  This could only happen if the
   *    worker considers a task running, but the scheduler does not.  A
   *    "normal" reason for this to happen is that updateStatus(task ended)
   *    has a partial failure.  Throws if a task with the same ID is already
   *    running (the code also CHECKs that the a invocation ID is never sent
   *    twice, but the CHECK should be changed to an exception if this is
   *    actually possible).
   *  - [delay] If a delay is long enough that the scheduler decided via
   *    notifyIfTasksNotRunning + updateStatus(was not running) that the
   *    task is not running, then the runTask will fail the sequence number
   *    check, and throw.  Otherwise, the scheduler still considers the task
   *    to be running, and there is no harm in starting the task a bit late.
   *  - [identity] Throws if the scheduler ID or the worker ID does not
   *    match (except if the task is a special "new worker" healthcheck, in
   *    which case the scheduler ID is not checked, see code).

   *
   * Robustness:

   *    the reason being that such mismatches can happen if
   *    notifyIfTasksNotRunning is delayed.
   *
   * == Rationale ==
   *
   * There are a few reasons I chose to poll the read-only
   * notifyIfTasksNotRunning() instead of retrying runTask() periodically
   * until the worker is lost.
   *
   * Practically speaking, read-only polling is simpler than pushing with
   * side effects:
   *  - Retries are a superset of the logic that was added for
   *    notifyIfTasksNotRunning.  Specifically, they would incur extra
   *    complexity in RemoteWorkerRunner, since the retry logic would have
   *    to do curry all the state needed to run the task.  They would also
   *    need to assert that the worker and scheduler states are still
   *    compatible with running the task.
   *  - Retries are much more expensive, both because they are not batched,
   *    and because they involve bigger requests.
   *  - Retries would deliberately try to runTask() on known-unhealthy
   *    workers.  Bugs in this state would have worse consequences than if a
   *    known-unhealthy worker is polled via notifyIfTasksNotRunning(), so
   *    this increases the test burden.
   *  - The retry code has to be careful regarding sequencing with future
   *    invocations of the same task.
   *
   * Philosophically, read-only polling follows the "do no further harm"
   * creed, which is appropriate given that Bistro tries never to exceed
   * resource constraints or start duplicate tasks:
   *  - With notifyIfTasksNotRunning, each iteration leads to increasing
   *    certainty that the task is NOT running, so that by the time the
   *    worker is lost, we're pretty darn sure.
   *  - With retries, every new attempt _might_ start the task the task
   *    without the scheduler knowing about it (just like the first
   *    attempt), which means that under some conditions (e.g. the worker
   *    -> scheduler network routes are congested), we could even increase
   *    the probability that there's a task running unknown to the
   *    scheduler.  This seems like a bad idea in the face of the unreliable
   *    communications that caused the retry in the fist place.
   *
   * Last, but not least, there are many ways to implement "poll to check if
   * the task is running".  Here are two rejected alternatives:
   *
   * - Instead of a sequence number, use a TTL with runTask, and wait longer
   *   than the TTL to send the first notifyIfTasksNotRunning().  Requires
   *   the worker to estimate the clock-skew, and adjust the TTL
   *   accordingly.  Not implemented due to excessive complexity.
   *
   * - Instead of notifyIfTasksNotRunning(), use a synchronous
   *   areTasksRunning() call, whose return value indicates which tasks are
   *   **NOT** running.  It is a mistake to indicate the tasks that are
   *   truly running, because it's best that the worker treats tasks with
   *   wrong invocation IDs the same way as running tasks.  It is much
   *   harder to reason about inter-call interactions in this setup, since
   *   this adds yet another way to mutate task status on the scheduler.

  /**
   * If this succeeds, the worker commits suicide before the request is
   * over.  So, the scheduler's side of the request _always_ fails.
    *
   * Robustness:
   *  - [failure] If the transmission or the worker side fails, and the
   *    worker stays alive, the scheduler will repeat the requestSuicide
   *    whenever it receives another heartbeat from the worker.
   *  - [partial failure] Does not apply -- the scheduler side always fails.
   *  - [replay, delay] The worker does not implement replay or delay
   *    protection.  For associated workers, this is okay, because the
   *    scheduler changes its state before dispatching a suicide request in
   *    such a way as to reject any future updates from this worker.  If the
   *    call fails, the scheduler will reply with "suicide" to every
   *    subsequent heartbeat it receives.
   *
   *    For non-associated workers, this bad sequence of events is possible:
   *     - scheduler sent requestSuicide (since the current worker was ok)
   *     - worker sent & got response to a 2nd heartbeat, and got associated
   *     - worker received the (much delayed) requestSuicide
   *     - worker died
   *    TODO(#5024460): (lo-pri) Fix by e.g. adding a timestamp to the
   *    request and refusing requests that are too old.  Doing this right
   *    would require require reviving the clock-skew measurement diff.
   *  - [identity] The IDs in the request prevent suicide of the wrong
   *    worker, and requests from the wrong scheduler.
   *  - [ordering] There are no ordering issues with other calls since the

   * be running tasks) that was temporarily inaccessible due to a network
