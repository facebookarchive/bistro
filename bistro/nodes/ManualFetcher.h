 * NodeFetcher that is manually configured. The configuration format is:
 *
 *   "source": "manual",
 *   "prefs" : {
 *     "node1" : ["child1", "child2", "child3"],
 *     "node2" : ["child4", "child5", "child6"],
 *     "node3" : "node2",
 *     "disabled_node4" : {"disabled": true, "children": ["child7"]}
 *   }
 *
 * It's a map of node to list of children for that node. Any nodes not
 * listed in the children list of another node will default to being
 * children of the instance level.
 *
 * Note that if you specify the same child name twice, you are going to end
 * up with two different nodes, or replicas, rather than with two different
 * parents.
