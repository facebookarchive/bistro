/**
 * A task subprocess can exit, while leaving behind other descendants that
 * are still running.  Normal POSIX process handling has no way of tracking
 * or reaping these, but Linux CGroups enable it.
 *
 * asyncCGroupReaper() makes a self-owning, EventBase-dwelling callback that:
 *  - Returns a future, which is fulfilled only when **all** of the task's
 *    cgroups become empty (or are deleted by the system `release_agent`).
 *  - Tries to `rmdir` any cgroups that become empty, in case the system
 *    `release_agent` is not enabled.
 *  - Logs about the intransigent task to raise awareness of leaky tasks.
 *  - If a `freezer` cgroup is available or if `killWithoutFreezer` is set,
 *    SIGKILLs processes in that cgroup.
 *
 * All of these functions are executed on an exponential backoff schedule,
 * since we expect that tasks stuck in D state (e.g.  due to buggy kernel
 * drivers) can persist for a long time.
