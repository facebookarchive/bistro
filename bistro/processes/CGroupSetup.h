/**
 * Place the child into the given Linux cgroups before starting it.  The
 * paths must point to the cgroups' `/cgroup.procs` or `/tasks` files to
 * modify.  The subprocess will start only if all placements succeed.  If
 * any of the cgroup placements fail, the remaining placements will still be
 * tried, ensuring that any brand-new cgroups made just for this process
 * will be immediately eligible for "notify_on_release", and will not leak.
 *
 * CGroup placement must occur between fork() and exec(), or the exec()ed
 * code could race to create processes outside the cgroup.
 *
 * Hints on creating / maintaining cgroups for use with this facility:
 *
 *  - Consider using your deployment automation to set up your host's
 *      /sys/fs/cgroup/{cpu,cpuacct,memory,...}/release_agent
 *    with an auto-cleanup script, e.g.:
 *      #!/bin/sh
 *      /bin/logger "Removing memory cgroup: $@"
 *      sudo /bin/rmdir -p "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/$1"
 *
 *  - You will need access to /sys/fs/cgroup/{cpu,memory,...} either
 *    via `chmod a+wt` or via a run-as-root service, so that you can create
 *    and configure the cgroups' directories.  Remember to set
 *    `notify_on_release` to 1 in your cgroup to enable auto-delete.
 *

 * **Please** read the warnings in folly/Subprocess.h or in CGroupSetup.cpp.
