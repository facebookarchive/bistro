 * characters are broken up into adjacent "lines" with no trailing newlines
 * Caller provides command line (array of strings) and timeout.
 * Important!!!
 * If subprocess opens a next generation of subprocesses with the inherited
 * stderr/stdout FDs and some level of independence, i.e detach themselves from
 * the process group and keep the stderr/stdout FDs open then timeout won't
 * work, because function will be waiting for stderr/stdout FDs get closed.
 * In such case function would hang up till life time of sub-subprocesses.
