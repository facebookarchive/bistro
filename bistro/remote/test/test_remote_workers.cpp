 * This is a "script"-style test, which executes a carefully choreographed

 * workers.
 *
 * It explicitly ignores the following aspects of RemoteWorkers, which are
 * tested separately:
 *  - initial worker set IDs (they are set so as to avoid consensus)
 *  - health status (workers are never made to become healthy)
 *  - initial wait logic -- we never leave initial wait
 *
 * The goal is to cover:
 *  - consensusPermitsBecomingHealthy(RemoteWorker)
 *  - indirectVersionsOfNonMustDieWorkers_ (including version propagation)
 *  - history_ (including adding/removing workers, pruning history steps)
 *  - mutation of RemoteWorker::indirectWorkerSetID()
 *
 * It also covers updates to nonMustDieWorkerSetID_ via addWorker().
