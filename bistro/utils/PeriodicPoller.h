/**
 * If you want to use a background thread to periodically poll for updates
 * to a certain piece of data, while handling transient exceptions, the
 * correct logic can be tricky to write.  This utility assures a correct
 * implementation.
 *
 * This class helps in several ways:
 *
 *  - It curries results / exceptions (akin to std::future).
 *
 *  - It polls on construction, so you can immediately get a valid value.
 *
 *  - It is hard to correctly use threads that are bound to class lifetimes
 *    (see the docblock of BackgroundThreads). This class makes it safe by
 *    handling state & thread lifetimes correctly, and providing just one
 *    thread-safe accessor: getDataOrThrow().  You can still break it by
 *    providing a fetch_raw_data that captures 'this', or members of your
 *    class that aren't fully initialized, but it's harder to accidentally
 *    shoot yourself in the foot.
 *
 *  - Most pollers fetch from an external data source (which may fail
 *    transiently), and then perform side-effect-free parsing (which will
 *    always fail until the data changes).  You may define processRawData()
 *    to avoid pointlessly hitting the same exception due to transient fetch
 *    failures.
 *
 *  - If the data you are polling has a version or modification time,
 *    fetchRawData can return 'false' to signal that the data has not
 *    changed, short-circuiting further processing.
 *
 *  - In the presence of exceptions, the version tracking is easy to get
 *    wrong.  PollerState protects you from the common errors.  It must be
 *    default-constructible, and support assignment.  It will only be used
 *    in the background thread.  The PollerState is always re-created on
 *    exception, protecting you from subtle bugs -- e.g. memoizing bad
 *    objects (like sockets), or:
 *      - fetch good data
 *      - hit transient exception
 *      - fetch the same good data
 *      - erroneously return nullptr since you cached only the good state
 *
 *   - There are two polling intervals: normal (period) and after an
 *     exception (retry_period).
 *
 * DO: This is already exercised by e.g. FileConfigPoller's test, but a
 * dedicated test would be better.
