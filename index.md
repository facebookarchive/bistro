## Why Use Bistro?

## Early-release software

Although Bistro has been in production at Facebook for over 3 years, the
present public release is partial, including just the server components. 
The CLI tools and web UI will be shipping shortly.

The good news is that the parts that are released are continuously verified
by build & unit tests on <a
href="https://travis-ci.org/facebook/bistro">Travis CI</a>, so they should
work out of the box.

There is already a lot of code, with which to play, so you have any thoughts
--- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bistro.scheduler/">write us a
note</a>!  Open-source projects thrive and grow on encouragement and
feedback.

## As flexible as a library

Although Bistro comes as a ready-to-deploy service, it may be helpful to
think of it as a library.  In our experience at Facebook, many teams'
distributed computing needs are highly individual, requiring more
customization over time.

Luckily, Bistro can adapt to your needs in three different ways.

**1. Configuration**: most aspects of a Bistro deployment can be tuned:

XXX Linkify these headings once written -- 
 * [Configuration](docs/config-source/):
 * [Persistence](docs/persistence/):
 * [Code execution](docs/execution/):
 * [Data shards](docs/data-shards/):
{:/comment}

 * Configuration: 
   continuously re-read a file, or a more custom solution
 * Persistence: 
   use no database, SQLite, or something fancier
 * Code execution: 
   run alongside the scheduler, or on remote workers
 * Data shards: 
   manually configured, periodic, or script-generated

**2. Plugins**: Bistro's architecture is highly pluggable, so adding your
own code is a cinch:
 
 * Can't find the right scheduling policy? Write your own <a
   href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/blob/main/bistro/scheduler/LongTailSchedulerPolicy.cpp">
   in about 50 lines of C++</a>.
 * <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/blob/main/bistro/statuses/SQLiteTaskStore.h">
   Need a different DB</a>?
   <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/blob/main/bistro/nodes/ScriptFetcher.h">
   Shard source</a>?
   <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/blob/main/bistro/config/FileConfigLoader.h">
   Configuration source</a>?

Every plugin you <a
href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">
contribute back to the community</a> makes the next person's customization
easier.

**3. Embedding**: Or, link just the pieces you want into your custom
application.  Need a <a
href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/tree/master/bistro/cron"> C++ cron
library</a>?  An optionally-persistent <a
href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/bistro/tree/master/bistro/statuses">task
status store</a>?
