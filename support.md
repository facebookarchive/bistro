You can reach the maintainers in two complementary ways:

### Facebook Group

Join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bistro.scheduler">the Bistro
group</a> to subscribe to discussions, feature polls, and announcements. 
{::comment} XXX By comparison, our <a href="/bistro/blog/">blog</a> focuses
only on the larger updates, and is not interactive.  {:/comment}

The group is also a good place to ask new-user questions (search first ;),
and otherwise interact with the community.

### Bugs, questions, suggestions

If you've found a bug, or just feel more comfortable with Github, please <a
href="https://github.com/facebook/bistro/issues/new">file an issue</a>.
